\title{Temporal disaggregation of a time series by model-based Denton proportional
method}
\usage{
denton_modelbased(
  series,
  indicator,
  differencing = 1,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),
  conversion.obsposition = 1,
  outliers = NULL,
  fixedBIratios = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. It must be either an object
of class ts or a numeric vector.}

\item{indicator}{High-frequency indicator. Mandatory. It must be of same
class as series}

\item{differencing}{Not implemented yet. Keep it equals to 1 (Denton PFD
method).}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. Usually "Sum" or "Average". Sum by
default.}

\item{conversion.obsposition}{Position of the observation in the aggregated
period (only used with "UserDefined" conversion)}

\item{outliers}{a list of structured definition of the outlier periods and
their intensity. The period must be submitted first in the format
YYYY-MM-DD and enclosed in quotation marks. This must be followed by an
equal sign and the intensity of the outlier, defined as the relative value
of the 'innovation variances' (1= normal situation)}

\item{fixedBIratios}{a list of structured definition of the periods where the
BI ratios must be fixed. The period must be submitted first in the format
YYYY-MM-DD and enclosed in quotation marks. This must be followed by an
equal sign and the value of the BI ratio.}
}
\value{
an object of class 'JD3MBDenton'
}
\description{
Denton proportional method can be expressed as a statistical model in a State
space representation (see documentation for the definition of states). This
approach is interesting as it allows more flexibility in the model such as
the inclusion of outliers (level shift in the Benchmark to Indicator ratio)
that could otherwise induce unintended wave effects with standard Denton
method. Outliers and their intensity are defined by changing the value of the
'innovation variances'.
